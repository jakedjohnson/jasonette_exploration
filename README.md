# jasonette_exploration

Attempting an integration of Jasonette into the JSON view rendering of Phoenix.

# Local Setup

Coming soon.

# Project Details

Project was set up with `mix phx.new jasonette_exploration --no-html --no-brunch --no-ecto`.

# Dependency or umbrella app?

 Phoenix was really only brought in for ease of testing a simple Heroku setup for the Jasonette endpoint. If it remains necessary to keep it a seperate app, can be integrated as an umbrella app to main web app. If it's possible to just create a mix project with documentation of how to use it as a module within the app, drop Phoenix and just publish the Mix project.
